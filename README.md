# hello-world

Name's Ernests


Decent Human from baltics, who likes the grand world of numbers and possibilities of programming, and also i like to nap.. A LOT.
one of my first languages i learnt in programming was PASCAL , after that i tried learning JAVA , didn't have much luck with that , but now i have fallen in love with Python 3.7 , or just Python, i like C++ too , but i like python just a little little bit more.
